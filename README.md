| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario**                        | Scenario number (1, 2, â€¦ 500)                      | Each simulated market scenario                  |
| **GSPC / Hang Seng / DAX / Nikkei** | Daily values of portfolio securities               | Taken from market/index data                    |
| **Portfolio**                       | Total portfolio value for that scenario            | Sum of individual securities' values            |
| **Profit / Loss**                   | Gain or loss in USD for that scenario              | `Portfolio - Initial Portfolio Value`           |
| **Bins**                            | Intervals of losses/gains                          | Example: -600, -550, â€¦ 500                      |
| **Frequency**                       | Number of scenarios in that bin                    | Count of portfolio outcomes falling in that bin |
| **Rel Freq (Relative Frequency)**   | % of total scenarios in the bin                    | `Frequency / Total Scenarios`                   |
| **Cum Freq (Cumulative Frequency)** | Cumulative % of scenarios up to that bin           | Sum of previous Rel Freq + current Rel Freq     |
| **NLoss**                           | Reference loss value for Normal distribution       | Same as bin center or specific loss point       |

This Excel workbook is designed to **analyze the potential losses of a diversified portfolio** consisting of multiple securities under different market scenarios. It calculates scenario-wise portfolio values, profits, and losses to help **quantify risk**.

## Workbook Contents

1. **Portfolio Composition**

   * Lists securities like **GSPC (S&P 500), Hang Seng, DAX, Nikkei**.
   * Shows investment amount (Value in USD) and current price of each security.

2. **Scenario Analysis**

   * Simulates portfolio value under multiple hypothetical market scenarios.
   * Calculates **profit and loss** for each scenario.
   * Updates individual security values using:

     ```
     Scenario Value = Investment * (Next Day / Current Price)
     ```

3. **Loss Distribution**

   * Uses **bins, frequency, relative frequency, cumulative frequency** to show how often certain loss ranges occur.
   * Helps visualize **portfolio risk profile**.

4. **Statistical Metrics**

   * Minimum Loss, Maximum Gain, Mean, Standard Deviation, Skewness, Kurtosis.
   * Provides insights into **extreme losses, volatility, and distribution characteristics** of portfolio returns.


5. **Loss Statistics (NLoss, F(Nloss), Normal, Tloss, Std T, T):**

   * Provides **advanced risk metrics** for portfolio analysis.
   * Includes **normal distribution percentages, T-distribution calculations, and standardized loss values**.
   * Helps assess **extreme loss probabilities** and **tail risk**.

6. **Insightful Interpretation:**

   * Most portfolio scenarios cluster around **small gains/losses (0 to Â±50 USD)**.
   * Extreme losses (e.g., -600 to -300 USD) are **rare**, shown by very low relative frequencies.
   * This distribution helps **calculate Value at Risk (VaR)** and **stress test portfolio performance**.

---

## Purpose

* To help investors or risk managers understand **how a portfolio reacts to market fluctuations**.
* To quantify potential **worst-case losses** using historical or scenario-based simulations.
* * To visualize and quantify **portfolio risk exposure**.
* To provide investors and risk managers with **scenario-based probability estimates of potential losses or gains**.
* To support **VaR calculation and risk management decisions**.
